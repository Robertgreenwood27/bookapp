The call center hummed with a subdued energy, the usual clamor of voices muted as if the very air had grown thick with tension. Arris sat in his cubicle, acutely aware of the sidelong glances and hushed whispers that followed his every move. The shadows around him seemed to pulse with an otherworldly rhythm, visible only to his eyes.

Arris's skin, paler than ever, had taken on an almost translucent quality. The network of dark veins beneath pulsed with barely contained power, a constant reminder of the changes coursing through him. He tugged at his collar, ensuring every inch of his neck was covered.

*Another day in this place. Another test of my control. They sense something's different, but they have no idea of the power that lies just beneath the surface.*

The familiar chirp of an incoming call pierced the uneasy quiet. Arris's hand hovered over his headset, a mix of anticipation and dread coursing through him. Part of him craved the opportunity to exert his will, to delve into the minds of unsuspecting callers. But another part, a dwindling remnant of his former self, recoiled at the thought.

*I shouldn't be here. It's not safe. I'm not safe. But where else can I go?*

With a resigned sigh, Arris donned his headset. The mask of normalcy felt heavier than ever, threatening to crack at any moment. As he prepared to take the call, the shadows around him writhed, eager to be unleashed.

<!-- Call 7 -->

Chirp. Another call. Swipe. Click. Here we go again.

"Pulse Telecom, this is Arris." His voice, once carefully modulated to project warmth, now carried an edge of barely contained intensity.

"Hi, um, I'm calling about my bill," a hesitant voice began. "There's a charge I don't recognize-"

Arris felt the familiar surge of power, the temptation to delve into the caller's mind almost overwhelming. He gritted his teeth, fighting for control.

*No. Don't lose it. Not again. But... just a little peek couldn't hurt, could it?*

"I see," Arris interrupted, his tone sharp. "Let me guess. You didn't bother to read the detailed breakdown we provided. Typical."

As he spoke, Arris reached out with his mind, brushing against the caller's thoughts. A wave of confusion, fear, and insecurity washed over him. He drank it in, feeling a rush of dark satisfaction.

*So much fear. So much weakness. I could crush their will with a thought. Make them see things my way.*

"I... I did try to understand it," the caller stammered. "But it's confusing, and I-"

"Of course it's confusing to you," Arris cut in, his voice taking on that strange, compelling timbre. "But let me enlighten you. That charge you don't recognize? It's for the premium package you agreed to last month. Remember now?"

As he spoke, Arris pushed harder, not just sensing the caller's emotions but attempting to reshape their memories. He felt a resistance, a flicker of the caller's true recollection fighting against his influence.

*That's it. Fight me. It only makes this more interesting.*

"I don't... I mean, I guess I do remember something about that," the caller said, uncertainty clear in their voice. "But I could have sworn I didn't-"

"Are you calling me a liar?" Arris snapped, the shadows around him writhing in response to his anger. "I have the recording right here. Would you like me to play it for you? To remind you of your own incompetence?"

There was a pause, then a shaky exhale. "No, that's... that's okay. I'm sorry for wasting your time. I'll pay the bill."

As the call ended, Arris felt a rush of triumph mixed with a twinge of something else. Guilt? Remorse? He pushed the feeling aside, focusing instead on the intoxicating sense of power.

*Another mind bent to my will. Another victory. But why does it feel so... hollow?*

The shadows around him pulsed, hungry for more. Arris glanced at his reflection in the computer screen, startled by the darkness swirling in his eyes. For a moment, just a moment, he wondered if he'd gone too far.

But then the next call chirped in his ear, and all doubts were forgotten in the rush of anticipation.

<!-- End call 7 -->

As he ended the call, Arris became aware of eyes on him. He turned to see Lila watching from across the room, her face a mixture of concern and determination. For a moment, something stirred within him - a flicker of the man he used to be, reaching out for human connection.

*Lila... Do you see what's happening to me? Can you understand the struggle inside me?*

Their eyes met, and Arris felt a jolt of connection. Lila didn't flinch or look away. Instead, she took a step forward, her gaze filled with a compassion that pierced through the shadows swirling around him.

*She's not afraid. She should be, but she's not. Why?*

The shadows within him surged, urging him to push her away, to revel in his newfound power. But that small part of him, the part that still clung to his humanity, held on to the connection.

Throughout the day, Arris continued to navigate calls with an unsettling efficiency. He dipped into minds, sensing emotions and thoughts, using his abilities to resolve issues with unnerving speed. Customer satisfaction scores were a mixed bag - some calls ended with unprecedented success, while others left customers feeling strangely uneasy.

As the workday drew to a close, Arris stood, his movements carrying a new, predatory grace. The shadows around him seemed to pulse, causing the fluorescent lights to flicker slightly. He heard a few uneasy murmurs from his coworkers.

*They sense something's different. They don't understand, but they feel it. The power that's growing within me.*

Arris walked through the call center, aware of the mix of curious and apprehensive glances that followed him. As he reached the exit, he paused, turning to survey the room one last time.

*This place, these people... they used to be my whole world. Now they feel so... small. But why does that realization bring me no joy?*

For a moment, Arris felt the power within him surge, hungry for release. The shadows writhed, eager to be unleashed. But as his gaze fell on Lila, still watching him with that unwavering compassion, he felt a flicker of his old self push back against the darkness.

*No. Not here. Not them. I'm not... I'm not that far gone. Am I?*

As Arris left the building, the shadows clung to him like a second skin. He stepped into the gathering dusk, feeling caught between two worlds - the familiar routine he was leaving behind, and the unknown potential that lay before him.

Chirp. Another day ends. Swipe. Click. Here we go again. But this time, as Arris walked away from the call center, he carried with him both the intoxicating allure of his growing powers and the weight of his fading humanity.

Deep within the darkest corners of his mind, the man he used to be clung to that last connection, that look of compassion from Lila, like a lifeline in a storm of shadows.

The key turned in the lock with a soft click that seemed unnaturally loud in the quiet hallway. Arris pushed open the door to his apartment, the shadows around him shifting restlessly as he entered the once-familiar space. The air felt thick and heavy, charged with an energy he couldn't quite explain.

*Home sweet home. Or is it? Nothing feels the same anymore. I've changed... but how much?*

As Arris moved through the dimly lit rooms, he became aware of an unusual silence. The typical sounds of his beloved pets - the scurrying of tiny feet, the rustling of scales against substrate - were conspicuously absent.

In the spare room, Arris flicked on the lights. The soft glow of heat lamps illuminated a scene that made his heart clench. Nyx, his Mexican Red Knee tarantula, was pressed against the far corner of her enclosure, legs drawn tight against her body. Ouroboros, the ball python, was coiled into a defensive ball, her head tucked away.

*What's wrong? Don't you recognize me? I'm still Arris. Still your caretaker.*

He approached Draco's bearded dragon enclosure, tapping gently on the glass. Normally, this would bring the lizard scurrying forward, eager for attention. But now, Draco remained still, his eyes fixed on Arris with an wariness that felt like a physical blow.

A wave of guilt and regret washed over Arris, momentarily pushing back the churning shadows within him. He backed out of the room, closing the door with shaking hands.

*Control. I need control. But how can I control something I barely understand?*

His phone buzzed in his pocket. With trembling fingers, Arris pulled it out. The screen glitched for a moment before stabilizing, showing a flood of notifications. Missed calls from work. Text messages from Lila, each more concerned than the last.

*It's me. I'm affecting everything around me. But I can't stop it. Can't control it. What am I becoming?*

The shadows around Arris grew more pronounced, reaching out to touch the walls, the floor, the ceiling. In the kitchen, he heard the soft hum of the refrigerator stutter and change pitch. The microwave's display flickered, showing random symbols before going dark.

The harsh bathroom light offered Arris no comfort as he confronted his reflection. His skin, now almost translucent, revealed a complex network of dark veins beneath. But it was his eyes that truly unsettled him - where once warm brown had resided, now swirled bottomless pools of shadow that seemed to devour the very light around them.

*Is this me? Is this what I'm becoming? Something beyond human?*

As he stared at his reflection, a thin crack appeared in the mirror's surface, spreading slowly like a growing web. Arris stumbled back, his heartbeat thundering in his ears.

He fled the bathroom, then the apartment, needing to escape the suffocating pressure of his own power. The night air hit him like a physical force, cool and damp against his feverish skin.

The street was quiet, but Arris could feel the hum of electricity in the air, the pulse of the city's lifeblood. As he walked, streetlights flickered, and he heard the occasional pop of a transformer in the distance.

*I can't stay here. Can't be around people. Not until I understand what's happening to me.*

With no destination in mind, Arris began to walk. The shadows clung to him, a visible manifestation of the turmoil within. And as he disappeared into the night, the city seemed to hold its breath, sensing that something had fundamentally changed.

For hours, Arris wandered the darkened streets, his path lit only by the stars and the occasional functioning streetlight. The weight of his power pressed down on him, a burden that grew heavier with each step. As the first hints of dawn began to color the sky, he found himself drawn back to the one place he could call home – his apartment.

*Home. Is it even that anymore? Can anywhere be home for... whatever I'm becoming?*

Arris trudged up the stairs, each step an effort against the exhaustion that saturated his being. He pushed open his apartment door, greeted by familiar yet now alien surroundings. Without bothering to turn on the lights, he made his way to his bedroom.

Instead of collapsing onto the bed as he desperately wanted to, Arris slid down the wall beside it, coming to rest on the floor. He drew his knees up to his chest, wrapping his arms around them as if trying to hold himself together.

*Sleep. I need sleep. Maybe if I just close my eyes, all of this will have been a nightmare.*

But sleep refused to come. Arris sat there, motionless, as the room gradually lightened with the approaching day. His mind raced, replaying the events of the past weeks, the changes he'd undergone, the fear he'd seen in the eyes of those around him – even his beloved pets.

The shadows around him pulsed and writhed, responding to his tumultuous thoughts. Hours passed, marked only by the steadily increasing light seeping through the curtains.
Then, breaking the oppressive silence:

Chirp.

Arris's eyes snapped open, focusing on his clock on the nightstand. 5:30 AM. Time for another day at the call center. Another day of pretending to be normal. Of holding back the tide of power that threatened to overflow at any moment.

*Shit.*

Swipe. Click.

*I guess we go again.*

With a groan that seemed to come from the depths of his soul, Arris pushed himself to his feet. Arris barely recognized the being that stared back from the mirror. Pale as death, with veins pulsing darkly beneath paper-thin skin, he looked more specter than human. His eyes, once windows to his soul, now appeared as vortexes of living shadow, hinting at the immense and terrifying power that churned within him.

*Another day. Another mask. How long can I keep this up? Do I even want to?*

As Arris began to prepare for work, the shadows clung to him, a constant reminder of the power that simmered just beneath the surface. Deep within, a part of him wondered if today would be the day he finally embraced his new abilities completely.

Arris stepped out into the morning light, he carried with him the weight of a night spent confronting the being he was becoming.

The call center loomed before Arris, a monument to monotony now transformed into an arena of potential. As he approached, each step heavy with exhaustion and a strange anticipation, the air grew thick with tension. Shadows shifted around him, responding to his conflicted emotions.

*Just another day. Just have to make it through. Keep it together. Or do I let them see?*

The automatic doors slid open with a hiss. Arris stepped inside, the fluorescent lights flickering slightly in his presence. He could feel the eyes of his coworkers on him, a mixture of unease and fascination in their gazes.

As he made his way to his cubicle, Arris was acutely aware of the hushed conversations that fell silent at his approach. He sank into his chair, the familiar confines of his workspace feeling both constraining and oddly comforting.

*I shouldn't be here. It's not safe. I'm not the same person I was. But where else can I go?*

He had nowhere else to turn. Nothing else to do but play out this semblance of normalcy until... until what? Until he could no longer contain the power growing within him? Until he found a way to control it? Or until he finally decided to let it loose?

As Arris prepared for his first call, a part of him thrilled at the possibilities that lay ahead, while another part clung desperately to the routine that had once defined his life.

<!-- Call 8 -->

Chirp. Another call. Swipe. Click. Here we go again.

"Pulse Telecom, this is Arris." His voice resonated with a subtle, unsettling power.

"Hi, I'm calling about my bill," a hesitant voice began. "There's a charge I don't under-"

Arris felt the familiar surge of power, stronger than ever before. The temptation to delve into the caller's mind was overwhelming.

*Why am I still pretending? This job, these people... they're so small compared to what I've become.*

"Stop," Arris commanded, his voice taking on a multi-layered quality that seemed to bypass the ears and speak directly to the mind. "Your confusion is irrelevant. Your concerns are meaningless."

As he spoke, Arris reached out with his mind, no longer content with merely sensing surface thoughts. He pushed deeper, brushing against the caller's core consciousness.

The caller gasped, their words faltering. "What... what's happening? I feel strange..."

Arris could sense the caller's mind, fragile and exposed. It would be so easy to reshape it, to bend their will entirely to his own. The shadows around him pulsed hungrily.

*This is true power. I could remake them, remake everyone. Why should I limit myself?*

But as he prepared to exert his full influence, a small voice in the back of his mind cried out. A memory surfaced - Lila's concerned face, his pets cowering in fear.

*No. This isn't right. This isn't me. Not yet. Not completely.*

With tremendous effort, Arris pulled back. "Your bill," he said, his voice still layered with power but no longer overwhelming. "The charge is for network upgrades. It's detailed in your contract."

"I... yes, I see it now," the caller replied, their voice dazed. "Thank you. I think."

As the call ended, Arris felt a rush of conflicting emotions. The power thrumming through him was intoxicating, but the realization of how close he'd come to completely dominating another person's mind was sobering.

The shadows around his cubicle writhed, responding to his inner turmoil. A few nearby lights flickered, and he could sense his coworkers' unease.

Arris sat motionless, his mind reeling. He'd touched the peak of his power, had tasted what it would be like to truly let go. And while part of him craved more, another part recoiled at what he'd almost become.

*I'm standing on the edge of an abyss. One more step and there might be no coming back. Is that what I want? Is that who I am now?*

As the next call chirped in his ear, Arris hesitated. For the first time in weeks, he wasn't sure if he could trust himself to answer.

<!-- End call 8 -->

"Arris! Stop this!" Lila's voice cut through the pandemonium. She stood at the edge of the darkness, her face a mixture of terror and desperate hope. "This isn't you! You're better than this!"

For a moment, just a moment, Arris hesitated. A flicker of his old self, buried beneath layers of darkness and power, reached out towards Lila's outstretched hand.

*Lila... I... What am I doing? What have I become?*

But the moment passed, swallowed by a tidal wave of power and rage. The shadows surged, coiling around Arris like a protective cocoon. He locked eyes with Lila, his gaze penetrating into her mind.

"I'm not better than this," Arris snarled, his voice echoing with inhuman power. "I am this. This is what I was always meant to be."

With a thought, Arris reached into Lila's mind, erasing her concern, her fear, her very awareness of the situation. Her eyes glazed over, body swaying slightly as her consciousness retreated.

*How dare they. How dare any of them try to hold me back. To cage me. To deny me what is rightfully mine.*

The fury built within Arris, a maelstrom of dark energy that threatened to tear him apart. He threw his head back and screamed, a sound of pure rage and power, enough to shatter windows and send cracks spiderwebbing across the walls.

The energy exploded outward, a shockwave of darkness that engulfed the entire building. Electronics sparked and died, their circuits overloaded by the surge of power. The very foundations of the building groaned, straining against forces they were never designed to withstand.

As the shockwave spread beyond the call center, Arris felt it touch other minds, other buildings. He could sense the entire city laid out before him, a web of lights flickering and dying as his power washed over them.

*The whole city. I can feel all of it. Every mind, every soul. I could bend them all to my will with a thought. Reshape their reality, their very perceptions.*

But even as the intoxicating rush of power flooded through him, a small voice in the back of Arris's mind cried out in horror. A memory surfaced - his pets, cowering in fear. The creatures he had sworn to protect, now threatened by the very power he wielded.

*No... No! My pets. They're in danger. I have to... I have to stop this.*

With a Herculean effort, Arris reined in his power. The shadows receded, retreating into him like water down a drain. The air cleared, the oppressive weight of his rage lifting.

As his awareness returned, Arris saw the impact of his outburst. The call center was silent, all activity frozen. His coworkers stood motionless, their faces a mix of shock, fear, and awe. Some stared at him with wide eyes, others averted their gaze, as if afraid to meet his. Lila stood motionless, her eyes vacant, mind wiped clean of the trauma she'd just witnessed. Outside, he could hear sirens wailing, the city in chaos.

*What have I done? I have to get home. Have to make sure they're safe.*

Without a backward glance, Arris fled the scene. As he ran through the streets, he could feel the tenuous control he had regained already beginning to slip. The shadows within him roiled and churned, hungry for more chaos, more destruction.

As Arris raced towards home, he knew that everything hung in the balance. His humanity, his sanity, the very fabric of reality - all teetered on the edge of oblivion.

Bursting into his apartment, Arris rushed to the spare room where his pets were kept. His heart raced as he opened the door, dreading what he might find. The room was pitch black and unnaturally cold, the carefully maintained habitats now silent and still. Panic gripped him as he thought of his beloved creatures, their delicate lives threatened by the sudden loss of heat and light.

With trembling hands, Arris reached for his phone. The screen glitched and flickered, but he managed to dial the electric company. Each ring stretched into eternity.

*Please. Someone answer. They're counting on me. I can't let them down again.*

Chirp. Another call. Swipe. Click.

"Thank you for calling City Power and Light. This is Alex. How can I assist you today?"

In that instant, before Arris could speak, he heard it. Not with his ears, but in his mind. Alex's unspoken thought, clear as day:

*Here we go again.*

Arris froze, mouth open, words dying in his throat. The silence stretched, a void filled with unspoken understanding.

"Hello?" Alex's voice again, concerned. "Is anyone there?"

The rage that had fueled Arris began to ebb, replaced by a clarity he hadn't felt in weeks. The shadows receded, revealing pale, ordinary flesh beneath.

Around him, the apartment stirred. Lights flickered, then grew stronger. The hum of electricity filled the air, normality flooding back.

"Uh... sorry," Arris mumbled, his voice hoarse and unfamiliar. He ended the call, the phone slipping from his fingers.

In the soft glow of restored light, Arris turned to the spare room. His pets stirred, no longer huddled in fear. Nyx emerged from her hide, Ouroboros uncoiled, tongue flicking curiously.

Arris let out a long, shuddering breath. The weight of everything pressed down on him, but beneath it all, a glimmer of hope.

With slow movements, he checked each pet, the familiar routine grounding him. As dawn crept through the windows, Arris finally rested, setting his alarm in a surreal act of normalcy.

Sleep came swiftly, dreamless and deep.

At 5:30 AM, the alarm chirped. Arris's eyes opened, clear and alert. For a moment, he simply lay there, feeling the weight of his body, the coolness of the air.

Chirp. Another day. Swipe. Click. Here we go again.
